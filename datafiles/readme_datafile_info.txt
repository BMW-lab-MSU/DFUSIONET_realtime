Irrigation_rec will have all site_specific Arable and SpatialET data in folders and subfolders. The directory should be:

*the keyword Arable is a must

For Spatial ET:
Irrigation_rec/[sitename]/SpatialET/Spatial_[1 spatial ET file for each date].xlsx

*the keyword Spatial is a must
**the date format in the file name should be [monthname (3) letters, day (2) digits, year (4) digits]
